","I feel that there are more resources at the moment for students to get more information and what they need to transfer to a four year university.  Also information is more accessible and flexible, community colleges are doing their best to promote and push their students to transfer to a four year university by creating information sessions in person and virtually.  ","Everything was very challenging, but it's because I was out of school for 10 years.  In my case I am not a regular transfer student.  I was in the workforce and transfer my Accounting generals to do a Computer Science major.  It was challenging because everything was new.  ","I knew it was going to be challenging, and I had to dedicate extra time reviewing basic math concepts.  But so far the experience have been great with the career plan change that I did.

"My counselor in high school was not helpful on giving me access to various opportunities, I was valedictorian in high school and had been part of various extracurricular activities but due to my undocumented status she said the only viable option was community college however once ai was there it was very hard to pay out of pocket and then I found out too late about my options for a full ride scholarship to transfer to a 4 year institution. Regardless my undocumented status has also limited my opportunities for internships specifically in a computer science related field because the advisor at Northeastern does not keep the legal status of their students. Most if not all opportunities are targeted to US citizens.","I needed a place where I could afford tuition, Northeastern being the most affordable.

",My career plans have not changed after transfering to my current university. Even when I was at Oakton I always wanted to major in Computer Science. ,"An experience that definitely helped me be successful at Neiu as a computer science student is utilizing the resources on campus such as the tutoring center when I needed help or clarification on something. Other than seeing the professor, Oakton didnt really have a tutoring center just dedicated to helping out computer science students. As a transfer student to Neiu that is majoring in cs, knowing the available resources I feel is very important. "

This person also helped me understand what kind of criteria I would need get accepted for each university I possibly planning to enroll in, and helped me plan my semesters strategically so that I could graduate in a timely manner.

Smaller class sizes and more individual attention from professors
Flexibility in class schedules and course offerings, including online options

Desire for a traditional college experience, including living on campus and participating in campus life
","Transferability of credits: It is important to ensure that credits earned at the current institution can be transferred to the desired transfer institution. The compatibility of transfer credits between institutions can save time and money in the long run.

For example, credit transfer issues or changes in academic requirements may cause delays in graduation, which may affect the student's post-graduation plans.","computing major transfer students may face challenges in finding internship or job opportunities, as many companies may prefer to hire students who have completed their entire degree program at a single institution.

"At my senior year at High School, I was deciding what to do after I graduate and all seniors were asked what they planned to do after high school and to talk to their counselors, I decided to apply to a single 4 year university, I got rejected. It was in the late summer, I was looking for colleges through the internet and I found out about community college, it was nearby and was easy to apply to, it was cheap and I found out my financial aid could cover all of the costs, I knew I wanted to invest my time studying about computers and community college offered it, after two years I transferred to a 4 year college to invest into my career.","If it is nearby (or easy to get to on public transportation), the costs, whether I was rejected or accepted, if my financial aid is still in good standing, what degrees they offered.

 Before graduating high school I was already immersed into my local community college.

I went to a 4 year university in Florida in 2007. It was a big mistake for me because I could not commit to the work and I ended up leaving after 3 years with few credits and a lot of debt. I always wanted to finish school and finally had the means to at least give it a shot in 2016. My job was stressful so I wanted the shortest time commitment in case I wished to bail again. Community college seemed like the best option for that.,"After I felt comfortable and strong as a student, I knew I would pursue a full bachelor's degree. Community college helped me learn that I was capable.","Many: I had more than 80 credits, but my current college only allowed me to transfer 80 flat. I had plenty of electives, but more were required at my current university. I was never informed of a ""diversity credit"" needed until my second to last semester. My automated degree audit showed the need for GenED while I was advised as a transfer from a community college that they would never be required for me. Difficulty mapping classes one-to-one. I pretty much never had an advisor after my first semester - the first person left, then I reached out to the department chair and team for many months with no reply (to this day I don't know who my advisor is supposed to be). My current college does not offer some required courses after 5PM, making full time (9-5 office work) impossible during some semesters.","I was working full time at a mortgage loan origination branch of a federally chartered bank. Once I came to my current college, after a few semesters I realized some classes would never be available to me after work hours. As a result, I had to leave my job to attend school for 1 full year to graduate. I had planned to stay at the bank as long as I could and until I could find a full time job that fit my major.","Connecting with Career Services as early as possible was a huge help. It helped me understand what I needed to do. I was still working full time at the time I first started attending, so I neglected the resource for most of my college career.

1. There were many parts in the process that made me go to the university several times because a document was missing or a new step was needed. 
I used to be an international student. And there are two more issues:
2. for first semester I had to be full time, which I was planning on entering the summer. But Full time during the summer was not an option since I believe it was going to affect my learning. 
3. The Office of international students did not mention that I had my student visa expired and that I had to get a new one. An officer from the border let me know and then I went to make the process for the student visa. There was a delay so I joined classes two weeks after. ",i changed my major to Computer Science.

This caused me to treat those college classes as another normal high school level class. Now that the high school is not there to mediate between me and my current institution, I had to learn how to be more independent. My ability to communicate with other is quite lacking, but I had to push myself out of my comfort zone. ","Initially, my plan was to just graduate with a bachelor's degree with a general CS degree. However, after transferring to my current institution, I learned of several programs that would allow me to further my education and save some money in the process.","I attended a high school who was part of the early college program. This program allows students to graduate with an associates degree as well as their high school diploma. This is my third semester at my 4-year university, but I'm considered a junior due to my total credits. I have been interested in gaining more experience that is related to my major, but I feel intimidated by such opportunities. I have no prior experience and due to my total credits I can only apply to internships, for example, that are for junior level or higher. Because of this, I feel like I'm not qualified enough to participate in such opportunities. "
