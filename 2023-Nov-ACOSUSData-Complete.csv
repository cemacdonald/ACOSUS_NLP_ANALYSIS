TITLE OF STUDY: AN AI-DRIVEN COUNSELING SYSTEM FOR UNDERREPRESENTED TRANSFER STUDENTS



The following is a short summary of this study to help you decide whether to be a part of this study. Information that is more detailed is listed later on in this form.

 The purpose of this research is to identify various student success factors in designing an AI-driven student advising education management information system. It will help identify the potential challenges for transfer students, potential gaps in course curriculum at community colleges and 4-year universities, and the social and psychological factors affecting the confidence and preparedness of transfer students.
 You are being invited to participate because you are a current student at a community college or you transferred from a community college to a 4-year university.
 You will be asked to participate in an online survey. We expect you to be in this study for 15 minutes to take the survey. We may follow up with you for a virtual interview.


COMPENSATION: If you agree to take part in this research study, you will receive a $10 Amazon gift card for completing the survey. 



CONFIDENTIALITY: The data will only be used for research purposes and will not be shared with anyone beyond the study team. The computers that host these data will be password protected and the login credentials will not be shared with anyone other than the investigator himself/herself. All personal identifiers will be stored in a separate file.



CONTACT FOR QUESTIONS: The subject referenced Initial Review application has been reviewed and approved by the expedited review process on 01/25/2023 as defined in 45 CFR 46.110 (Protocol #202). If you have any questions regarding your participation, please feel free to contact the principal investigator, Xiwei Wang, xwang9@neiu.edu. If you have any questions regarding your rights as a participant you can contact the Institutional Review Board at (773) 442-4674 or at IRB@neiu.edu.

-cost",,,,University of Texas at El Paso,El Paso Community College,Computer Science,,1,,"'- I had problems adjusting to the new environment. The community college and high school made it easier for me to take classes at both locations. This caused me to treat those college classes as another normal high school level class. Now that the high school is not there to mediate between me and my current institution, I had to learn how to be more independent. My ability to communicate with other is quite lacking, but I had to push myself out of my comfort zone. ","Initially, my plan was to just graduate with a bachelor's degree with a general CS degree. However, after transferring to my current institution, I learned of several programs that would allow me to further my education and save some money in the process.","I attended a high school who was part of the early college program. This program allows students to graduate with an associates degree as well as their high school diploma. This is my third semester at my 4-year university, but I'm considered a junior due to my total credits. I have been interested in gaining more experience that is related to my major, but I feel intimidated by such opportunities. I have no prior experience and due to my total credits I can only apply to internships, for example, that are for junior level or higher. Because of this, I feel like I'm not qualified enough to participate in such opportunities. ",3.3,2.5,Junior student at a 4-year university,No,Cristina Sabanero,csguijarro041903@gmail.com,
